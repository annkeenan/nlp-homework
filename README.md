# CSE40667 - Natural Language Processing

## Homework Assignments

#### **Homework 1**

In situations where text input is slow (mobile phones, Chinese/Japanese characters, users with disabilities), it can be helpful for the computer to be able to guess the next character(s) the user will type. In this assignment, you'll build a character language model and test how well it can predict the next character.

#### **Homework 2**

When processing text in languages without standardized spelling rules, or historical texts that followed rules that are no longer considered standard, spelling normalization is a necessary first step. In this assignment, you will build a model that learns how to convert Shakespeare's original English spelling to modern English spelling.

#### **Homework 3**

In this assignment you will build and improve a simple parser trained from the ATIS portion of the Penn Treebank. ATIS (Air Traffic Information System) portion consists of short queries and commands spoken by users of a fake robot travel agent.

#### **Homework 4**

In this assignment you will build and improve a named entity recognizer for Tweets. This was the shared task for WNUT 2016. This is a very difficult task, with human performance in the upper 60%'s and machine performance ranging from 20% to 50%.

#### **Homework 5**

In 2005, a blog post went viral that showed a bootleg copy of Revenge of the Sith with its Chinese version translated (apparently by low-quality machine translation) back into English. Can you do better?

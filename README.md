# CSE40667 - Natural Language Processing

## Homework Assignments

#### **Homework 1**

In situations where text input is slow (mobile phones, Chinese/Japanese characters, users with disabilities), it can be helpful for the computer to be able to guess the next character(s) the user will type. In this assignment, you'll build a character language model and test how well it can predict the next character.

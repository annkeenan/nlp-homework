# CSE40667 - Natural Language Processing

## Homework Assignments

#### **Homework 1**

In situations where text input is slow (mobile phones, Chinese/Japanese characters, users with disabilities), it can be helpful for the computer to be able to guess the next character(s) the user will type. In this assignment, you'll build a character language model and test how well it can predict the next character.

#### **Homework 2**

When processing text in languages without standardized spelling rules, or historical texts that followed rules that are no longer considered standard, spelling normalization is a necessary first step. In this assignment, you will build a model that learns how to convert Shakespeare's original English spelling to modern English spelling.
